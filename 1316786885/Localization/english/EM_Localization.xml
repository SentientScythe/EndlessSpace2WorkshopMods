 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_LgBinaryB2_Title">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_LgBinaryB2_Desc">Large Binary Moons:
Exploration reports have now confirmed that in addition to mineral wealth, these moons also have numerous archaeological ruins scattered around the surface.
While this is indeed fantastic news, already corporate lawyers are arguing about which areas should be allocated to industry, and which for research. </LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_LgBinaryB3_Title">Developed Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_LgBinaryB3_Desc">Large Binary Moons:
Due to the ceaseless squabbling over land rights, government intervention was eventually required, lest everything grind to a halt.
Even though neither the science nor industrial trades could agree on territory, government contracts and grant money placated enough of the top brass on either side, that large scale development could finally begin in earnest.
Nowadays, one would hardly believe the tumultuous political history of the lunar colonies.</LocalizationPair>


 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_VolcanicA2_Title">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_VolcanicA2_Desc">Volcanic Moon:
Now that extensive composition analyses have been completed, more intensive efforts can be made to harvest the raw production potential of this active moon.

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FrozenC2_Title">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FrozenC2_Desc">Frozen Moon:
It was originally assumed that this moon would be ideal for certain types of science, but be otherwise unremarkable.
However, analysis teams have discovered that most of the structural ores and minerals are infused with concentrations of dust. Extraction is proving to be somewhat challenging on larger scales, but it's clear there is much value to be had.
On the down side, the infused ores seem to be fairly useless for industrial purposes.</LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FrozenC3_Title">Developed Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FrozenC3_Desc">Frozen Moon:
Now with large-scale extraction, processing, and refinement infrastructure in place around the moon, dust deposits are finally being worked in scalable quantities.
Additionally, there's been heavy investment into the various research camps, and now those industries too, are thriving on this once unremarkable moon. </LocalizationPair>

  
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileA2_Title">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileA2_Desc">Fertile Moon:

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileA3_Title">Developed Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileA3_Desc">Fertile Moon:
It's no surprise that the rich lunar lands have attracted millions of new residents over the years. The moon provides a pleasant environment, and the extensive farmlands provide wide open spaces free of city congestion.
While recent urbanization projects have sprung up due to the growing economy and demand for housing, much of the lunar land is reserved for crops by law.</LocalizationPair>

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileB2_Title">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileB2_Desc">Fertile Moon:
While the air on this moon is a little thiner than what would be ideal for farming, no one is really complaining either. It turns out that the land is suprisingly rich with micro dust particles, and it does have its own varieties of fungal crops that have adapted well.
It's true that the moon is a bit mineral-poor, but the low gravity means importing raw materials is greatly simplified. </LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileB3_Title">Developed Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileB3_Desc">Fertile Moon:
With a little encouragement from government contracts, the fungus farms have done quite well at providing a readily packageable, nutrient rich food sources used in military rations.
With a booming economy, and plenty of dust-infused lands, immigration shows no sign of slowing. The robust infrastructure development initially designed to scale the farms has allowed new cities to spring up seemingly overnight.</LocalizationPair>

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileC2_Title">Explored Moon</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_FertileC2_Desc">Fertile Moon:
More careful study of this moon's unique ecology has revealed a treasure trove of untamed plants, wildlife, and microscopic organisms.

With so many economic opportunities and a strong travel industry, this fertile moon's future always looked bright. Though large portions of the surface are dedicated to farmland, some of the urban centers are beginning to rival major cities on much larger worlds.
The popularity and steady growth of the moon have economists projecting unbelievable returns in the decades to come.</LocalizationPair>


 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiA2_Title">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiA2_Desc">Multiple Moons:
Initial survey results, as well as the more detailed studies, have revealed that nearly all of these moons have heavy concentrations of useful ore and minerals. Much more than was initially expected, really.
As an added bonus, one of the moons even supports some unusual fungal growth that is readily edible.
Investing in long-term growth here will payback large dividends in productivity, and the industrialists in the empire are more than happy to get the ball rolling.</LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiA3_Title">Developed Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiA3_Desc">Multiple Moons:
There were so many opportunities for mining rights, mineral processing, smelting, and refining, that a whole generation of entrepreneurs became obscenely wealthy.
Now fully developed, this network of industrialization supports a whole system of various trades, and will only continue to improve.</LocalizationPair>

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiB2_Title">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiB2_Desc">Multiple Moons:
Specialized analysis of the orbiting moons has revealed many opportunities for industry, and this was expected. What wasn't expected, was the realitively high abundance of some of the rarer elements critical in many high-tech applications.
These deposits are already contributing greatly to the dust value of the system. With further development in infrastructure and manpower, these sites can be scaled up for even better yields.</LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiB3_Title">Developed Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiB3_Desc">Multiple Moons:
Increased access to rare lunar elements have given rise to many new industries, and it was only natural to continue to increase extraction and processing to meet the new demand.
Now, the lunar bases and networks have become complete cities in their own right, comprising its own ecosystem and even requiring special "economic zones" with their own sets of laws and regulations.
While this complicates the bureaucracy, no one can deny the yields the industry produces as a whole.</LocalizationPair>

 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiC2_Title">Explored Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiC2_Desc">Multiple Moons:
The moons of this system have been studied, and they reveal great diversity from minerals, to archaeology, to even a thin pseudo-atmosphere on one of the moons being maintained by equatorial geysers.
There are a wealth of opportunities to exploit, should the necessary investments be made, that can benefit new and old economies alike.</LocalizationPair>
 	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiC3_Title">Developed Moons</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_MultiC3_Desc">Multiple Moons:
Lunar transit and freight services are booming. And it's no wonder, with all the diverse industries that have built up.

Glorious columns of alien machinery now effortlessly extract ore and minerals from the lunar core. And in other sections, vast underground domes manufacture transportable nutrient pods.
No one is really sure of all the science behind it, but dedicated research teams have learned a trick or two about the underground warp-displacement logistic tunnels. So much so, that improved travel techniques are already being disseminated throughout the empire.
Also found within the databases, plans for constructing giant dust-harvesting structures designed to skim the outer layers of the atmosphere of gas giants.
With more study, it seems clear that the benefits from temple operations could be increased, and perhaps more discoveries are waiting within unexplored areas of the various tunnels.

In many ways, it seems the inner workings and designs of the "temple" somehow actively contribute to the wellbeing of the diverse races.

Researchers have also uncovered a number of technologies related to orbital hydroponics, and engineers are already adapting the findings into practical applications.
And still, the temple promises more.
Among the vast technological caverns, there is still much more to restore to working order. As parts of the temple were coaxed back to life, it was also revealed that a non-functional relic in orbit is actually a transport portal of some kind.

Across the fertile lunar surface, work of all types began to be automated.
It's not immediately clear just how every task fits into the whole, but at the center of it all seems to be an unusual AI mind, not like the more familiar AI management processors built today. This one, seems to gather and analyze theoretical socio-economic data in unexpected ways.
Additionally, your engineering and research teams have been able to successfully reverse-engineer equipment to automatically mine and process lunar ore, which is then neatly dispatched around the system.

Your teams of restoration experts have finally brought the temple to some kind of operational status. They report that the main difficulty seemed to be that the original facility was in an uncompleted state. For whatever reason, it looks like the Endless had abandoned the project.
Nevertheless, there is much value here. There seem to be vast lengths of tunnels dug into this large moon providing some easy mineral access, and many seem to have habitat-like constructions. In addition, working order has been restored to automated growing chambers, and these are already providing edible food.
Lastly, the team has figured out the basic theory and operation of the abandoned drilling and construction machinery, and say that with some resources, it can be made functional again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Moon_LgSingB4_TK_Desc">Large Moon - Restored Temple:
There was complete success in reactivating the ancient drilling equipment. Working slowly and relentlessly, miles of new tunnels have been made deep into the moon. As this process continued, new automations came to life erecting additional growing chambers along the way.
All in all, this has created more living space, as well as providing even more access to food and minerals.
Unfortunately, the hulking drilling machines have suffered numerous breakdowns, and are unable to continue their work.
However, the engineering and science teams all agree that this is due to the advanced age of the equipment, and have devised a number of plans to make improvements and repairs.</LocalizationPair>

The bad news, is that the continued mining of the moon had progressed slowly during much of the time since re-activation, and there's been no end of problems on the work itself.
The good news, is the temple once again revealed it's still full of surprises. The theory, is that the frequent stoppages have triggered the production of additional machines to complete the task. New machines of a smaller and unknown design have been created by the tens-of-thousands to continue the work. And continue, they did.
Endless additional miles of tunnel have been bored into the moon. They've gone so deep, and so far beyond anyone's expectations, that many members of the teams are urging caution, saying that it's only prudent to examine the work in more detail before attempting to continue.
However, others counter, there's no way to effectively explore everything with more than cursory analysis. This has been done, of course, and hasn't revealed any immediate danger. So far, the automations have successfully avoided and adjusted for the instabilities and increasing complications of the deepest tunnels.
As an added bonus, some clever members of the team have worked out how to reprogram the industrious bots for other tasks and locations, allowing for their use across the empire.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeL_Desc">This temple seems to be designed as a focal point for Endless research.
Dedicating efforts to learning more about the temple will surely lead to valuable applications within the empire.
This research will take much effort and expense, but it must be done.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeM1_Title">Distributed Linkage Upgrade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeM1_Desc">Armed with the proper theoretical knowledge, restoration teams plan to reconnect the numerous nodes across the moon.
With a little luck, perhaps the temple will reveal the secrets of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeM2_Title">Distributed Linkage Upgrade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeM2_Desc">Improved material sciences and construction techniques should enable repairs and reconstruction of the miles of tunnels connecting the nodes. Hopefully, the non-functional nodes can be restored to working order as well.</LocalizationPair>
    
  
<!-- System Improvements -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarColonies_Title">Lunar Colonies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarColonies_Desc">Advanced construction and community development techniques have allowed for the construction of extensive lunar communities in ways not previously possible.
Even tiny moons can now be employed to provide a stable and livable space for populations, and existing colonies will benefit from additional livable areas.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarDataNetwork_Title">Lunar Data Network</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarDataNetwork_Desc">This network of science infrastructure is specifically designed for the study of moons and anomalies throughout system. It uses automated lunar hardware and collection points, as well as orbiting satellites to continuously process real-time signals.
These networks are capable of rapidly handeling huge volumes of data, includes in-line buffers, and redundant data storage nodes. They can be adjusted on-the-fly should local conditions change, and will automatically adapt to a wide range of dynamic environments.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarTourism_Title">Lunar Tourism</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarTourism_Desc">Government start-up grants, port infrastructure, and comprehensive travel and trade regulations can create the opportunity for private industries to offer safe and reliable tourist destinations among the various moons.
The extra tax revenue more than covers the bureaucratic costs, and citizens can enjoy increased freedom of movement around the system.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MoonExploitation_Title">Moon Exploitation Drones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MoonExploitation_Desc">Moons in the various planetary systems offer a wealth of opportunity. By utilizing a comprehensive network of drones capable of in-situ resource analysis, adaptable capabilities, and both real-time and predictive coordination, much of a moon's resource yield can be gathered by completely automated processes.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HunterGuilds_Title">Hunter Guilds</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HunterGuilds_Desc">Finding and raiding a lost Endless moon temple is a great honor for the clans that manage to do so. The locations and specifics of these temples are kept as highly guarded secrets, lest some other clan move in on their claim.
While this can be viewed as a fairly selfish activity, it's tolerated due to the potential benefits to the society as a whole.
Empire subsidized Hunter Guilds can be created anywhere this activity is taking place, providing formal regulation and support frameworks, along with media to spread tales of the greatest discoveries. Naturally, this also comes along with the taxation and tributes they will bring to the empire.
Keep an eye out for systems that can build this improvement, as it's a sure sign that there's a temple out there somewhere.
But if a temple is formally discovered, the hunters will have to find other places to raid and explore.</LocalizationPair>


<!-- Temple Granted Improvements -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HistoricalEnclave_Title">Historical Enclave</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HistoricalEnclave_Desc">Studies of the Deep Mind temple has enabled new ways to study ancient phenomena using immersive research and speciality AI constructs.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExoticResearchLab_Desc">Using research from temple Deep Mind, these automated facilities are able to continuously run sub-atomic research trials on the various strategic and luxury deposits found throughout the galaxy.
The work is painstaking, and generates vast amounts of data to sift through - hence the need for AI data science automation.
It's unusual methods are slow, but no one can deny their overall effectiveness.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%WatchmakerChildFacility_Title">Watchmaker Child Facility</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WatchmakerChildFacility_Desc">This facility, made possible by the Watchmaker temple, uses Endless dimensional technology to receive valuable production materials, as well as collect science data across a large dimensional network.
These facilities are actually fairly inexpensive, making them quite useful on newly colonized systems, but it does require the Watchmaker temple to be configured for "Export" to function.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GasHarvesters_Title">Gas Giant Harvesters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GasHarvesters_Desc">Discovered in Titan Wind, these giant floating structures are designed to collect trace dust elements by skimming the upper atmosphere of gas giants. And over time, they are able to convert this dust into a readily usable form, as well as provide valuable scientific data.
These harvesters are also able to provide living space for quite a number of citizens.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%RestorationDrones_Title">Restoration Drones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%RestorationDrones_Desc">Discovered in Titan Wind, these automated drones work to repair and rejuvenate damage done to a planet due to over-exploitation.
In addition, this vast bot network helps to facilitate other industrial applications across the planet.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ShipyardWorkCamps_Title">Shipyard Work Camps</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ShipyardWorkCamps_Desc">These construction zones were devised by one of the restoration teams at Hunter's Reach using insights and machinery from the temple's shipyards.
It turns out that the necessary work is highly unpopular with the populations of the empire, however there are plenty of minor races that can be persuaded to do the work.
Conditions are grueling in these bare-bones camps, but they are highly efficient at building the necessary parts for starship construction.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%OrbitalHydroponics_Title">Orbital Hydroponics</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%OrbitalHydroponics_Desc">Insight into Endless technology uncovered from the Metal Hearth temple has allowed the construction of these orbital facilities.
Crops grown here show impressive nutrient content and extraordinary growth response by utilizing zero-gravity growing and organic filtration techniques, along with a complex schedule of sunlight cycles.
Once grown and harvested, food-pods can be instantly dispatched to any area of the planet below.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TemplePortal_Title">Temple Portal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TemplePortal_Desc">Engineers have collected enough core parts from the Metal Hearth temple to construct a single portal.
This will allow starships to travel to other portals, but once built, this structure cannot be built again.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarOreDispatcher_Title">Lunar Ore Dispatchers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarOreDispatcher_Desc">Consisting of autonomous bots and mining equipment, these machines extract valuable ores and then launch them into orbit.
From there, they can easily be dispatched to any planet in the system.
These relatively inexpensive systems were reverse-engineered from parts and schematics found in the Quantum Order temple, and are ideal for new colonies with access to moons.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarCultureNetwork_Title">Dust Archive Culture Network</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarCultureNetwork_Desc">Clever arrangement of these custom network nodes across system moons brings access to the latest population activities of the Dust Archive temple, and these regular episodes and live feeds are much loved across the empire.
The technology involved in these AI-designed installations is fairly exotic and so deceptively simple, that some prominent researchers advise caution as to the exact intentions of their design and usage.
Still, no one can deny their immediate benefits to the empire.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarStrikeBase_Title">Lunar Strike Base</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarStrikeBase_Desc">Scientists and engineers have managed to recreate the long range bombardment weapons restored on Guardian's Post, albeit at a smaller scale.
This lunar installation will provide ground support in the event of an invasion, as well as housing a permanent military presence on the moon.
In addition, regular training exercises are administered here, increasing the experience of stationed fleets.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EntertainmentSpec_Title">Global Entertainment</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EntertainmentSpec_Desc">Using techniques learned from the Expanded Beauty temple, a whole world can be geared to providing entertainment for the system.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TempleBotOutpost_Title">Temple Bot Outpost</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TempleBotOutpost_Desc">Exploiting the sheer number of worker bots created by the Infinite Caverns temple, it was found that by relocating them to a new area, they could be retasked for a multitude of different uses, benefiting all areas of the economy from personal to commercial use.
Unfortunately, however, there are only so many bots to go around. So the more of these outposts that are in use, the less effective each one is.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebAnchor_Title">Web Anchor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebAnchor_Desc">Using schematics from temple Stellar Web, your engineering teams have managed to create a lunar structure deemed a Web Anchor.
This alien device creates a sort of dimensional linkage to the temple and other anchors. One of the side-effects of this linkage is that somehow local dust essence is extracted and sent back to the temple.
This structure also serves as a hub for exotic research, and is a natural community relations outpost as various cultures come together to wonder at the strange construction.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebBeacon_Title">Web Beacon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebBeacon_Desc">Now that more secrets have been uncovered at the Stellar Web temple, it's possible to upgrade existing Web Anchors.
The more of these devices that are constructed, the more they act in harmony to observe the galaxy and generate science to be processed at the temple.
The long-term implications of these observations are unclear, but the immediate benefits they provide are well understood.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MolecularExtractors_Title">Molecular Extractors</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MolecularExtractors_Desc">These advanced collection techniques utilize technology discovered in the Distributed Linkage temple.
Using vast networks of specialized nano drills and chemical agents, resource collection efficiency is greatly improved by being able to extract materials at a molecular level.
Unfortunately, this process is extremely expensive, and these extraction sites have a negative impact on industrial production, and this cost is magnified by increasing numbers of strategic resource sites.</LocalizationPair>

<!-- Modules -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportMoonExploration_Title">Moon Exploration Module</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportMoonExploration_Desc">Allows the exploration and survey of moons using hero and exploration ships.
