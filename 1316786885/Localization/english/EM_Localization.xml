Endless additional miles of tunnel have been bored into the moon. They've gone so deep, and so far beyond anyone's expectations, that many members of the teams are urging caution, saying that it's only prudent to examine the work in more detail before attempting to continue.

Who knows what will be uncovered?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Ring_Title">Convert Rings to Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Ring_Desc">Armed with the exotic technology of the Expanded Beauty temple, this planet's ring system can be collected and converted into a small moon.
This will provide all the benefits of lunar industry and population, though the beautiful rings will be irrevocably lost.</LocalizationPair>  

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_DestroyedMoon_Title">Rebuild Destroyed Moon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_DestroyedMoon_Desc">If it wasn't for the technology found in the Expanded Beauty temple, the lunar disaster may have been completely unrecoverable.
Fortunately, the wide-scale devestation can now be cleaned up, and the debris rings can be collected and once again formed into a moon.
However, the rebuilt moon will be much smaller than the original, and the process will take quite a bit of time.</LocalizationPair>  

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeG_Title">Metal Hearth Upgrade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeG_Desc">Continuing restoration of the temple is paramount, and understanding and restoring the ancient portal will have far-reaching implications for the empire.

And naturally, any work done in the temple is bound to improve other functions as well.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig3_Title">Begin Drilling</LocalizationPair> <!-- Infinite Caverns -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig3_Desc">Once the necessary resources have been procured, your science and engineering teams will attempt their plan of revitalizing the ancient equipment.
It's largely unknown what the end result will be, but that's what science is all about, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig4_Title">Continue Drilling</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig4_Desc">Now that it's clear what the machines do, they present a unique opportunity to increase the productivity of the planet below, as well as for the good of the system as a whole.
Assuming that the repairs go as planned and project leaders can iron out any hiccups along the way.
The project must continue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig5_Title">Continue Drilling</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig5_Desc">The additional working capacity created by the mysterious temple is a confirmation that the work is well within the limits of Endless technology - this is what they were designed for, after all.
The machines aren't done just yet, and with a little help, they can continue.
Sure, continuing the project will be expensive, but who can say what the long-term benefits will be? Perhaps even more discoveries are about to be revealed by the temple.
Keep digging.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig6_Title">Continue Drilling</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_Dig6_Desc">Yes, the work is dangerous. There's risk in everything. The trick is managing that risk.
It's clear that project leaders are being overly cautious, not willing to risk tarnishing their long careers.
It's understandable.
It's also is a perfect opportunity to let the junior members establish themselves.
Let the work continue!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeL_Title">Stellar Web Upgrade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Reduction_UpgradeL_Desc">This temple seems to be designed as a focal point for Endless research.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MoonExploitation_Desc">Moons in the various planetary systems offer a wealth of opportunity. By utilizing a comprehensive network of drones capable of in-situ resource analysis, adaptable capabilities, with both real-time and predictive coordination, much of a moon's resource yield can be gathered by completely automated processes.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HunterGuilds_Title">Hunter Guilds</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HunterGuilds_Desc">Finding and raiding a lost Endless moon temple is a great honor for the clans that manage to do so. The locations and specifics of these temples are kept as highly guarded secrets, lest some other clan move in on their claim.
While this can be viewed as a fairly selfish activity, it's tolerated due to the potential benefits to the society as a whole.
Empire subsidized Hunter Guilds can be created anywhere this activity is taking place, providing formal regulation and support frameworks, along with media to spread tales of the greatest discoveries. Naturally, this also comes along with the taxation and tributes they will bring to the empire.
Keep an eye out for systems that can build this improvement, as it's a sure sign that there's a temple out there somewhere.
But if a temple is formally discovered, the hunters will have to find other places to raid and explore.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarSanctuaries_Title">Lunar Sanctuaries</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarSanctuaries_Desc">Setting up hidden channels to allow planet sanctuaries to exploit local moons is no easy task.
But recent advances in non-corporeal physics have provided a way to access minerals and conduct lunar science projects.
These sanctuary extensions will provide vital long-term befefits to the empire as a whole.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessTechInfiltration_Title">[X] Infiltration Gateway</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessTechInfiltration_Desc">Endless technology left across this galaxy is quite different from that of the various races that currently claim it as their home. And carefull investigation of these differences are critical to greater understanding.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExoticResearchLab_Desc">Using research from temple Deep Mind, these automated facilities are able to continuously run sub-atomic research trials on the various strategic and luxury deposits found throughout the galaxy.
The work is painstaking, and generates vast amounts of data to sift through - hence the need for AI data science automation.
It's unusual methods are slow, but no one can deny their overall effectiveness.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%WatchmakerChildFacility_Title">Watchmaker Child Facility</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WatchmakerChildFacility_Desc">This facility, made possible by the Watchmaker temple, uses Endless dimensional technology to receive valuable production materials, as well as collect science data across a large dimensional network.
These facilities are actually fairly inexpensive, making them quite useful on newly colonized systems, but it does require the Watchmaker temple to be configured for "Export" to function.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GasHarvesters_Title">Gas Giant Harvesters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GasHarvesters_Desc">Discovered in Titan Wind, these giant floating structures are designed to collect trace dust elements by skimming the upper atmosphere of gas giants. And over time, they are able to convert this dust into a readily usable form, as well as provide valuable scientific data.
These harvesters are also able to provide living space for quite a number of citizens.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%RestorationDrones_Title">Restoration Drones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%RestorationDrones_Desc">Discovered in Titan Wind, these automated drones work to repair and rejuvenate damage done to a planet due to over-exploitation.
In addition, this vast bot network helps to facilitate other industrial applications across the planet.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ShipyardWorkCamps_Title">Shipyard Work Camps</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ShipyardWorkCamps_Desc">These construction zones were devised by one of the restoration teams at Hunter's Reach using insights and machinery from the temple's shipyards.
It turns out that the necessary work is highly unpopular with the populations of the empire, however there are plenty of minor races that can be persuaded to do the work.
Conditions are grueling in these bare-bones camps, but they are highly efficient at building the necessary parts for starship construction.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%OrbitalHydroponics_Title">Orbital Hydroponics</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%OrbitalHydroponics_Desc">Insight into Endless technology uncovered from the Metal Hearth temple has allowed the construction of these orbital facilities.
Crops grown here show impressive nutrient content and extraordinary growth response by utilizing zero-gravity growing and organic filtration techniques, along with a complex schedule of sunlight cycles.
Once grown and harvested, food-pods can be instantly dispatched to any area of the planet below.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TemplePortal_Title">Temple Portal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TemplePortal_Desc">Engineers have collected enough core parts from the Metal Hearth temple to construct a single portal.
This will allow starships to travel to other portals, but once built, this structure cannot be built again.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarOreDispatcher_Title">Lunar Ore Dispatchers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarOreDispatcher_Desc">Consisting of autonomous bots and mining equipment, these machines extract valuable ores and then launch them into orbit.
From there, they can easily be dispatched to any planet in the system.
These relatively inexpensive systems were reverse-engineered from parts and schematics found in the Quantum Order temple, and are ideal for new colonies with access to moons.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarCultureNetwork_Title">Dust Archive Culture Network</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarCultureNetwork_Desc">Clever arrangement of these custom network nodes across system moons brings access to the latest population activities of the Dust Archive temple, and these regular episodes and live feeds are much loved across the empire.
The technology involved in these AI-designed installations is fairly exotic and so deceptively simple, that some prominent researchers advise caution as to the exact intentions of their design and usage.
Still, no one can deny their immediate benefits to the empire.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarStrikeBase_Title">Lunar Strike Base</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LunarStrikeBase_Desc">Scientists and engineers have managed to recreate the long range bombardment weapons restored on Guardian's Post, albeit at a smaller scale.
This lunar installation will provide ground support in the event of an invasion, as well as housing a permanent military presence on the moon.
In addition, regular training exercises are administered here, increasing the experience of stationed fleets.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EntertainmentSpec_Title">Global Entertainment</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EntertainmentSpec_Desc">Using techniques learned from the Expanded Beauty temple, a whole world can be geared to providing entertainment for the system.
Vast areas are dedicated to resorts and tourist attractions, and these experiences are universally connected and coordinated.
Additionally, augmented reality overlays are applied planet-wide, allowing for unique and seamless AI-monitored experiences and gamification of every activity imaginable, from the mundane to the exotic.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TempleBotOutpost_Title">Temple Bot Outpost</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TempleBotOutpost_Desc">Exploiting the sheer number of worker bots created by the Infinite Caverns temple, it was found that by relocating them to a new area, they could be retasked for a multitude of different uses, benefiting all areas of the economy from personal to commercial use.
Unfortunately, however, there are only so many bots to go around. So the more of these outposts that are in use, the less effective each one is.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebAnchor_Title">Web Anchor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebAnchor_Desc">Using schematics from temple Stellar Web, your engineering teams have managed to create a lunar structure deemed a Web Anchor.
This alien device creates a sort of dimensional linkage to the temple and other anchors. One of the side-effects of this linkage is that somehow local dust essence is extracted and sent back to the temple.
This structure also serves as a hub for exotic research, and is a natural community relations outpost as various cultures come together to wonder at the strange construction.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebBeacon_Title">Web Beacon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%WebBeacon_Desc">Now that more secrets have been uncovered at the Stellar Web temple, it's possible to upgrade existing Web Anchors.
The more of these devices that are constructed, the more they act in harmony to observe the galaxy and generate science to be processed at the temple.
The long-term implications of these observations are unclear, but the immediate benefits they provide are well understood.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MolecularExtractors_Title">Molecular Extractors</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MolecularExtractors_Desc">These advanced collection techniques utilize technology discovered in the Distributed Linkage temple.
Using vast networks of specialized nano drills and chemical agents, resource collection efficiency is greatly improved by being able to extract materials at a molecular level.
Unfortunately, this process is extremely expensive, and these extraction sites have a negative impact on industrial production, and this cost is magnified by increasing numbers of strategic resource sites.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%CoreStackRouter_Title">Core Stack Router</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%CoreStackRouter_Desc">By extracting redundant or unused networking components from the Core Stack temple, ultra-advanced system routers can be deployed across the empire.
As more are installed, the smart networking routines can use increasingly efficient techniques and subtle side-channel analysis to realize hacking improvements across the board.</LocalizationPair>


<!-- Modules -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportMoonExploration_Title">Moon Exploration Module</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportMoonExploration_Desc">Allows the exploration and survey of moons using hero and exploration ships.
This is naturally useful to get good information on the best potential systems for new colonies, but can also reveal the presence of an Endless Moon Temple.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleOrbEngineProbe_Title">Scout Module</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleOrbEngineProbe_Desc">Advanced miniaturization techniques have allowed the creation of a compact engine and probe module.
