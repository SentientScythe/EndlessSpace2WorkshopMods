  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Hostile_Title">Lumeris Trade Princess</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Hostile_Description">The ships appear to be a merchant fleet, and their crew are ill-prepared to fend off your boarding parties. Early resistance is dealt with harshly. The traders are soon broken and cowed.

Your troops spend several weeks stripping the vessels of their cargo and resources, until the only question left is what you will do with their people.

Their leader--a Lumeris trade princess named Aurelia--comes before you to beg for mercy.

Her golden eyes are rimmed in black, the dark pigment now streaking down across her blue-skinned cheeks. 

Her voice is clear and defiant, and she speaks your language fluently. "You have taken everything from us. Cruel and without mercy," she spits the words out, before her voice softens.

Her angry lips--a delectable shade of peach--suddenly glide into a wide, suggestive smile. "Please. You are great and we are very weak. We see that now." Her voice softens even more, as if a lover's coo, "Please show me...and my people, mercy. Do not leave us to die out here among the stars."</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Title">Princess Begs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Description">Upon hearing of your decision, Aurelia comes before you once more: this time to beg for her own life.

Both the simmering anger and the veiled sweetness are gone; now there is only fear and desperation in her swollen, red eyes.

Bowing down low, she chooses her words carefully. "Please. I know that I can do no more for my people. I have led them as best as I can." She looks up--directly at you--and pleads, "But I can still be useful, if you allow me the chance."

Aurelia pauses, as if searching your language for just the right words. "As an advisor, perhaps? I know deals and I know dust. Allow me to council you. Please, let your interests become my own."

Lowering her eyes--her words gravely humble--she promises to earn her life in service to you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Advisor_Title">Advisor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Advisor_Description">Make her an advisor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Advisor_Objective">There is something about her. She may not deserve this honor, but you will allow her the chance to prove herself.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Slave_Description">Claim her as your personal slave.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Slave_Objective">She may serve, but certainly not as an advisor. From princess to slave, she will live out the rest of her days as your personal servant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Slave_ObjectiveTooltip">The princess will be furious at this humiliation</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessBegs_Ignore_Title">Ignore</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Title">Aurelia Adapts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Description">Your culture is dark and your society is brutal; you never expected a seemingly delicate flower like Aurelia to survive.

And yet she does so much more: Aurelia flourishes. It takes the former princess a few months to find her footing, but soon her influence can be felt at the heart of nearly every major plot or plan. Though she serves your closest advisors--and they universally do their best to diminish her contributions--you can feel her dark brilliance nearly everywhere.

The order to slaughter disobedient miners on a harsh moon--a swift escalation even your top generals would not have so boldly suggested--quells a potentially inconvenient rebellion before it can begin.

The genocide of an entire, indigent population in the slums of your capital--millions upon millions of souls--immediately frees up resources for another war front.

Aurelia is growing and changing; become darker and more cruel by the day. This intrigues you.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Intimate_Title">Intimate</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Intimate_Description">Demand her presence at a private dinner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Intimate_Objective">Demand her presence at a private dinner. You will nourish Aurelia and watch this dark flower grow.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Intimate_ObjectiveTooltip">Aurelia will be very interested in this opportunity.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Lover_Title">Lover</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Lover_Description">Demand that she become your lover.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Lover_Objective">Demand that she become your lover. In her newfound cruelty, Aurelia has earned the right to be your mate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Lover_ObjectiveTooltip">Aurelia desires the great power this will give her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Serve_Title">Serve</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Serve_Description">Allow Aurelia to continue to serve.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Serve_Objective">Allow Aurelia to continue to serve your great empire. She is but one among many who will enforce your will upon the cosmos.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAdapts_Serve_ObjectiveTooltip">Your interest will soon turn elsewhere.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessDarkServantEnding_Title">Aurelia is Dead</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessDarkServantEnding_Description">Aurelia continues to serve your great empire for many years to come.

Her ideas are often revoluntionary. Her plots usually take her enemies by surprise. But it is her gruesome efficiency that becomes a thing of legend.

One by one your closest advisors are stripped from you. This one by intrigue; that one by assassination. Everyone knows that it is Aurelia's hand that brings their downfall, but there is never any proof.

She suffers retaliation, of course; there are many attempts on her life. But it always end the same: her beautiful, Lumeris body coated in the red sheen of her attacker's blood.

Her fortunes rise and fall across the years, but she always continues her struggle. And in that struggle, she becomes something truly more: a beautiful monster.

And that is ultimately her downfall. She drifts so far from that young woman you met, all that time ago. She is too weak to accept the perfection that she has become.

Her slaves find her dead one morning, apparently by her own hand.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessDarkServantEnding_DarkServantEnding_Title">Aurelia is Dead</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAttemptsToAssassinateEnding_Title">Assassination Attempt</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessAttemptsToAssassinateEnding_Description">You take Aurelia as your personal servant and for years she fulfills her role.

In the early days you could often see the defiance in her eyes; the hatred that she bore for you and your cruelty. But over time it seemed to fade. Her voice became sweeter and her nature was more compliant. She seemed to know her place.

But it was all a lie.

You wake from sleep one night to find her on top of you, stolen blade in hand. She very nearly plunges it into your neck before you grasp her wrists and turn it back on her. The moment she senses that she has lost the struggle, her eyes go dark and she suddenly adds her force to your own; the wicked blade drives deep into her chest. Warm, red blood gushes out, soaking everything.

"Finally, I am free."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HarvestPrincessEnding_Description">You receive word that the trade princess is dead. Defiant to the end, Aurelia chose her own way out. 

She was being moved from a transport ship to a military processing facility when she disarmed one of your soldiers. Before Aurelia could be stopped, she managed to kill fifteen of your troops; she also took the lives of several of her own people. In the end, the trade princess turned the weapon on herself.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Title">Lumeris Trade Princess</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Description">Your ships spend several weeks helping the strangers. Their mission seems to be a blend of exploration, harvest, trade and diplomacy. It appears their vessels were attacked by frontier pirates.

While many races make up their crew, they are led by a Lumeris trade princess named Aurelia. 

"I greet you warmly, and thank you for coming to our rescue," she begins. Her voice is clear and vibrant, and she speaks your language fluently.

Golden eyes dart quickly across you. Rimmed in black and shimmering with a dust-infused pigment, they bespeak her great intelligence.

Her lips slide into a warm and easy smile. "Our ships," she starts, "they will not make the journey back to our homeworld. You have been so kind already. May we ask for more generosity?"</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Help_Title">Help</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Help_Description">Find them new ships to carry their cargo and crew home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Help_Objective">Find them new ships to carry their cargo and crew home. Aurelia should continue her trade mission; it's clear that she belongs among the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Help_ObjectiveTooltip">The trade princess would be extremely happy.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Assimilate_Title">Assimilate</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Assimilate_Objective">You would be honored to welcome them among your people. If their ships can no longer carry them across the stars, then perhaps Aurelia and her crew can make a new life on your homeworld.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Assimilate_ObjectiveTooltip">The trade princess would be very grateful.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Abandon_Title">Abandon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Abandon_Description">Leave Aurelia and her people to their fate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Abandon_Objective">You have done all that you are willing to do for Aurelia and her people. It is time for them to look after themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_MeetThePrincess_Friendly_Abandon_ObjectiveTooltip">The trade princess and her people probably won't survive.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Title">Aurelia Departs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Description">It was not easy. You spent an enormous amount of time, energy and resources cobbling together a fleet for Aurelia and her people. But it was worth it.

Your reward came in all the days that you were able to spend with the alluring Lumeris female. Afternoons and dinners devoted to going over all the little details became mere pretext to spend time talking and bonding. A blossoming friendship grew into something more; and by the end it seemed as if she might not go at all.

And yet this day was always coming: the day you would have to say farewell to Aurelia.

You stand at a hangar door. It seems far too plain a setting for such an monumental event.

The starkness is all the more heart-wrenching when Aurelia finally appears. Her lithe but curvacious body is draped in rich, red silks, and her golden eyes are rimmed as dark as the day you first met her.

Your eyes meet, and you both know that it is time to say goodbye.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Flirt_Title">Confess</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Flirt_Description">Confess your feelings to the trade princess.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Flirt_Objective">You may never see Aurelia again. You feel compelled to express your feelings. She may not be able to stay, but she will at least know how much you will miss her.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Flirt_ObjectiveTooltip">The trade princess will be deeply flattered by your actions.</LocalizationPair>
  
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Gift_Title">Gift</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Gift_Description">Offer the trade princess a great and expensive gift.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Gift_Objective">It has always been clear that Aurelia values the finest material things in life. You have decided on a great and expensive gift to convey your even greater affections to her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Respectful_Description">Keep your feelings--if you have any--to yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessLeaves_Respectful_Objective">Whatever your feelings, expressing them to Aurelia now seems cruel and unfair. You offer the trade princess a warm but respectful goodbye.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_LongRangeScanners_Title">Long Range Scanners</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_LongRangeScanners_Description">Your ships and remote scanning outposts pick up a large fleet of vessels headed towards your home system at high speed. At this range, it is impossible to tell if this is a war fleet. 

Your scientists estimate that they will arrive in just under three weeks.

Your advisors would like you to send ships to intercept these strangers.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_TradeDeal_Title">Trade Princess Returns</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_TradeDeal_Description">It seems that the worries were unfounded. While the new fleet is well-armed--sporting a number of very impressive gunships--its primary purpose is to facilitate trade.

They are led by a familiar face: the Lumeris trade princess Aurelia. 

She greets you at the same hangar door where you once said farewell, all those years ago. She wears the same red gown. Her golden eyes are rimmed as black as ever, and yet they seem changed; poignant somehow.

"I shared the story of your great generosity with my father and with my family. My people were very grateful for all that you did for us...for me," she tells you. "If you wish it, we have returned to offer you a trade alliance. It will make both of our nations very wealthy, and..." Her voice trails off for a moment as she looks away.

When she looks back, her peach lips quiver only slightly; the only hint of emotion on her still-youthful face. "Well, if you wish it, my family has suggested that I remain here." She smiles. "That I stay here as...a representative." Her smile broadens at the corners of her mouth as she looks away, "for trade."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_TradeDeal_Distant_ObjectiveTooltip">This action is impersonal and would hurt Aurelia's feelings.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_AssimilatePrincess_Title">Assimilate the Traders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_AssimilatePrincess_Description">It is a long and emotional journey for Aurelia and her people.

Before you arrived, they had very nearly accepted their end. If you had been of a more hostile bent, they would have died still; or worse. 

And now, huddled aboard your transport ships--taking only what they can carry--these refugees are about to start an entirely new life upon your homeworld. 

The gravity of their situation dawns on you during one of your many talks with the trade princess.

They will survive, of that you have no doubt. But to live and thrive? They will need to find some way of fitting in to your society. It may not be as easy for them as you wish it to be.

You look deep into Aurelia's dark-rimmed eyes during one of your final meetings with her. You realize that no matter how much you try to help them, you cannot save them from the hardship they will face.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HighSociety_Title">Red Houses</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HighSociety_Description">You made it easy for Aurelia and her people. Perhaps a bit too easy.

The Lumeris trade princess has grown wealthy over the past few years. Naturally shrewd and gifted with both language and the social graces, her people have spread throughout the trade and service sectors. They now hold many of the most desirable jobs in your economy, and it doesn't seem like they are content to stop there.

Most recently, Aurelia has begun to open her now infamous Red Houses. Dens of pleasure, these exotic and exclusive clubs see traffic by even the highest officials in your government. While the former trade princess and her developing cabal pay their taxes--generating a windfall of dust for your empire--there is now talk of blackmail, bribery, and other illicit scandals.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_LowSociety_Title">The Red House</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_LowSociety_Description">You didn't make it easy for Aurelia and her people. 

In the early days of their resettlement, the traders did their best to find honest jobs. They labored, gathered, and provided service work. Some of them found positions in your diplomatic corps, while the most skilled went to work in your research labs.

But poverty weighed heavy on Aurelia and her people. Isolated--and not entirely welcomed--by your native population, they turned to an easier life and sold a more base commodity: pleasure.

From the slums of your great capital, Aurelia now runs a wide-ranging operation. Blue-skinned urchins sell pleasure drugs on street corners. Lumeris dancers--barely clad and possessed of an exotic beauty--now dominate your culture's social clubs. Even other, minority races rally behind the trade princess; she has become a beacon for the "other" in your society.

The center of their collective--commonly called the Red House--is a large building in the heart of your slums. Countless vagrants, migrants and homeless people of all races gather there. While some of your advisors condemn it as a blight on your great city, there is an order to their community. Everyone at the Red House has a job and a purpose; everyone has a safe place to sleep at the Red House; and everyone eats.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_PrincessMarriageEnding_Description">Aurelia does well over the years. Her pleasure dens remain a mainstay of your empire's culture, and before too long they have spread throughout your colonies and into space itself. At last count she owned twelve great luxury liners, ferrying the richest and most influential individuals to and from your home system.

And her Red Houses have expanded their services as well. Originally they offered simple pleasure drugs and exotic dancers; but now almost any desire--from high-stakes gambling to the most deviant acts of passion--can be fulfilled in one of Aurelia's houses.

There was talk, for a time, that Aurelia might eventually set sail on one of her great ships; that she would travel back into the stars from which she came.

But then you hear of her wedding to one of the wealthiest ship-building magnates in your empire. It's nearly impossible to avoid the news. Aurelia has become a social darling in your culture, and her wedding is branded as the most luxurious event in a generation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_CultLeaderEnding_Title">Cult of the Red Flower</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_CultLeaderEnding_Description">Aurelia continues to nurture and grow her Red House in the slums. The building--originally a condemned warehouse--is gradually repaired. And as the years pass, the old structure becomes the center of a new and rising district. It starts with the nearby blocks, but it quickly spreads from there.

Violence disappears. There is an eerie calm in the streets. Those who live in the area can only describe it as a philosophy of thought; something that just clicks in the mind one day.

Aurelia's followers are everywhere. They are the same lost souls that followed her so many years ago, in the beginning. But now, instead of being poor and homeless and forgotten, they live in a plain sort of comfort. Decrepit houses and crumbling buildings have been rebuilt with the help of the entire community; now there is food and shelter for everyone. 

Aurelia herself is rarely seen these days. As her territory grew, she became more and more reclusive. Some say her followers have constructed tunnels beneath the city, and that Aurelia now lives in a secret, undergound complex. 

Others claim she is dead and some even whisper that she has become a divine being; a saint.

A cult springs up around Aurelia and a red flower--symbolic of a popular, plant-based pleasure drug that is widely sold on the streets of your capital--becomes her symbol.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExilePrincessHigh_Title">The Red Queen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExilePrincessHigh_Description">Aurelia uses her accumulated wealth, combined with extensive use of blackmail and her considerable political capital, to buy a massive fleet of ships. Most of them are older trade and military vessels, but one among them stands out: The Red Queen.

The largest and most advanced of your empire's privately-owned vessels, Aurelia somehow manages to acquire this ship. She immediately rebrands and retrofits it to her desires.

"For my protection," she says seductively, when confronted about the purchase.

Months later, Aurelia and her people disembark. The were ostensibly headed back to their system of origin, but you should have known better. Taking most of her people--as well as some of your own--Aurelia instead settles in and around the dense asteroid field of a nearby system, where she reportedly establishes a pirate's den. You send spies to investigate, and they tell you that she rules this new haven with a serpent's tongue.

Pleasure drugs and illicit goods--dark things of value--continue to flow freely into your empire, and you are powerless to stop it. Apparently Aurelia left her own network of spies and criminals behind when she left. 

Though the pirate queen may be exiled, her presence is felt everywhere. Again and again, her ships launch surgical strikes on your trade and transport vessels; almost as if she were being fed information. Some of your closest advisors are soon revealed to be spies, long ago turned by the dark secrets she kept on them. And worst of all, your native people clamor for the seductive narcotics only she manages to smuggle in.

Aurelia has you beat.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExilePrincessLow_Title">The Red Queen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExilePrincessLow_Description">You want Aurelia and her people gone. You want the blight of the Red House removed from your capital. 

Aurelia accepts your decision with an eerie grace. "As you wish," she promises, her smile saccharine sweet. "But please. Just a few more days to make our plans?"

It seems reasonable at the time, but it soon becomes clear that she never intended to leave.

Shortly before Aurelia is scheduled to depart with her closest advisors, they all suddenly go missing. When you send your troops into the slums to search for her, they find the Red House empty and abandoned. And no matter how high you set the bounty on her head, no one ever comes forward with her whereabouts. 

It's as if Aurelia and her people simply disappeared. But the pleasure drugs never stop flowing. And other substances---darker, more dangerous things--soon join them on the streets.

And then come the scandals erupting across your empire. Stories of blackmail, bribery, addiction and adultery begin to dominate your empire's news networks. It feels inescapable and inevitable; it feels like everything is falling apart.

But perhaps the most bizarre thing of all is the newly-coined myth of the Red Queen. Your people say her name in reverant whispers; some among them even begin to pray to her, as if she were a god. The Red Queen, protector of the poor and the keeper of secrets. She who is said to despise tyranny; she who lurks in the darkest shadows.

Aurelia has become invisble; but her presence can be felt everywhere.</LocalizationPair>

Her golden eyes seem to brighten the moment they find you. "It has been too long. I am so pleased to be here with you once more." Her lips--sheening brightly with golden dust--spread wide and easy. "Please, tell me. What may Aurelia do for you?"

Everything feels intimate and close; as if your last conversation had been only yesterday.

And the years have been very generous to Aurelia. It's hard to find signs of age in her gloriously graceful Lumeris body; but you can feel it in her soul. She seems even more composed, and her confidence and grace has grown exponentially. 

And perhaps most alarming is the deeply seductive quality to her every word and action. You can feel yourself being slowly drawn in by Aurelia's charm.</LocalizationPair>

By keeping her as an advisor, you get to witness Aurelia's talents firsthand. Her tongue drips with honeyed words. Her charisma is overwhelming and addictive. But most of all, she is supremely smart and tactical in everything she does. She listens, she studies, and when she finally acts, it is always with extreme ease and grace.

This continues for several years, until one day Aurelia comes to you with an idea. You've always kept her well-rewarded for her work, but she has never before asked you for anything specific. And yet this request seems very important to her.</LocalizationPair>

"I like it here," she murmurs, giving you a long gaze, golden eyes studying you deeply; intently. And then her playful smile returns again. "Would you be angry if I told you that this is really not very important to me at all?"

You ask her what she means, and she just laughs; the sound delicious to your ears. "What I really want," she starts, and then raising her arms wide, asks, "All of this?" You can't help but see the shape of her body as she spreads her hands up into the air; beneath her semi-sheer, golden robes, her form is firm and lithe and long, but full of gentle curves. And then she looks back down to you, bringing her arms around in a graceful sweep so that her palms are up; together; pointing at you.

"All of this, when all I want is you," she says finally, her face awash in a gentle glow; her sweet and honest eyes unguarded.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Title">Flower of Bliss</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Description">From orbit, the moon looks small, but vibrant. There is a singular continent on the planet-facing side of the tidally-locked moon. The landmass overflows with dense green jungles; it is punctuated by twisting rivers and a cascade of great lakes. Aqua blue, coastal shallows line the edges of this paradise.

But while they look beautiful from orbit, the jungles are terrifying in person. The canopy of the trees and the thick bush before you are alive with the squawks, chirps, roars, rustles and the buzzings of countless living creatures. In the distance, you even spot some hungry thing moving beneath the sun-baked sand.

Naturally, Aurelia runs ahead of you as soon as you land, her fingers touching this leafy thing and then that flower. "Come on! We have to explore!" she calls out across the windswept beach.

The dangers of the moon are quickly forgotten against Aurelia's pleasure. She begins to strip down almost immediately, so that the ferns and the flowers can brush against her naked skin. It would be embarassing if you didn't already know her so well from your private interactions. As she rubs her face and nose into a massive, glorious bloom, her eyes purr with pleasure.

"This one," she murmurs, dripping her long, slender fingers into a silky-clear nectar, "...is full of bliss." She looks up at you seductively, her face flooded in euphoria. "Try this...with me?" she begs, her words a slur of pleasure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Experiment_Title">Experiment</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Experiment_Description">Experiment with Aurelia.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Experiment_Objective">Experiment with Aurelia. It might not be smart, or safe, but you will chase all the pleasures of this existence with her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Decline_Description">Refuse to try Aurelia's flower.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Decline_Objective">Abstain from Aurelia's reckless experimentation. It might be fun to watch her indulge, but you will not put yourself at risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoon_Decline_ObjectiveTooltip">Aurelia will find you very dry and dull.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoonBonding_Title">The Bonding</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_ExploreMoonBonding_Description">The substance tastes sweet and otherworldly. From the moment it touches your tongue, your mind flies free. You spend days writhing in pleasure with Aurelia on the hot, sandy beaches. You wade into the warm waters together. You laugh and you giggle like children playing. Everything seems so happy and delerious. So lost. It's as if time just stops. You stop to think about that for what seems like...forever, and then you feel dizzy and then you realize that you're sitting beside a great, roaring fire with Aurelia.

The psychedelic high is wearing off now. Aurelia stares at you, her mind already clean and clear. How long has she been looking at you like that? How long will she continue to stare into your very soul, lost in a blissful peace.

"I love you," she says simply. It lacks all the gild and glimmer that normally adorns her words, but it is perfect this way. "I love you," she says again.

And then with a great big smile--a happy smile--she pulls something from an old, leather satchel that she brought with her to the moon. You've seen this bag before--in her private chambers--but she has never let you look inside it.

From the ancient leather, Aurelia pulls a dust-infused fern frond. In the dark of the night, it glows like a great torch, even brighter than the bonfire at your side. Sparkles of ancient gold drip like embers from its feathery leaves.

"This," she says, with a seductive smile, "is an ancient and rare thing. It comes from my homeworld. This plant is all but extinct now." She chuckles a bit, as she runs one finger across a brittle, glowing leaf. "A love fern. A dust fern. The essence of this thing has so much power." She pauses for a moment, as if lost in deep thought. "The power, even, to join two souls. Two bodies," she says, now looking directly at you. "If you do this with me, you will feel as I do. And I will always know your pleasures and your pains. For all the rest of our days, we will be as one."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HuntMoon_Title">Dangers Of The Hunt</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HuntMoon_Description">From orbit, the moon looks small, but vibrant. There is a singular continent on the planet-facing side of the tidally-locked moon. The landmass overflows with dense green jungles; it is punctuated by twisting rivers and a cascade of great lakes. Aqua blue, coastal shallows line the edges of this paradise.

But while they look beautiful from orbit, the jungles are even more terrifying in person. The canopy of the trees and the thick bush before you are alive with the squawks, chirps, roars, rustles and the buzzings of countless living creatures. In the distance, you even spot some hungry thing moving beneath the sun-baked sand.

You are here to share a hunt with Aurelia, and already you can see the lust in her eyes as she takes the weapon that you offer. "Nothing but the biggest and most dangerous prey will do," she exclaims, her golden eyes shining with enthusiasm.

You spend days moving through the thickets, following a winding river to a great, wide lake. You teach her how to move and stalk her prey, and on the second day she manages to take down a larger bird. You cook and eat it together. 

You see so many new species of animals as you travel and explore, but none strike you as worthy trophies until you stumble onto the trail of an apex predator. For days you hunt the beast, which looks to be some sort of great cat. It roams a very large territory, and as you reach one of its many dens--the floor covered in bleached-white bones--you can see that the hunt has taken a toll on Aurelia. She tries to carry on, but she is exhausted.

It is at that moment that the cat strikes. She never even sees it coming. Massive and covered in an inky black fur, it leaps at Aurelia, intending to take her down.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Quest -->

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HuntMoonBonding_Title">The Bonding</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_HuntMoonBonding_Description">You slip in and out of consciousness. Your dreams are angry and wild. Great, gaping maws filled with ivory teeth. The sweep of deathly-white claws across your chest. Your spear driving deep; driving home into the cat's chest, past thick bone and into bloody organs deep inside.

"Shh. Quiet now, my love," you hear Aurelia coo to you through the darkness. It takes a week for your fever to break, and then a few days more before you've regained most of your strength. She has been there, the entire time, nursing you back from the edge.

"It was a great fight," she tells you, describing in awe how you threw her out of harm's way and took on that monstrous cat to protect her. 

She tended your wounds, built a fire, and butchered that cat. The past week she has nursed you on its blood and meat. And while you rested, Aurelia cleaned its skin, just as you taught her.

On the night before you're set to head back to the shuttle, when your strength is nearly restored, Aurelia makes love to you. It is the most passionate and intense experience that you've ever shared with her. And at the end, she stares down at you, overwhelmed with emotion.

"I love you," she says simply. It lacks all the gild and glimmer that normally adorns her words, but it is perfect this way. "I love you," she says again.

And then with a great big smile--a happy smile--she pulls something from an old, leather satchel that she brought with her to the moon. You've seen this bag before--in her private chambers--but she has never let you look inside it.

"For all the rest of our days, we will be as one."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoon_Title">Aurelia and the Servants</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoon_Description">From orbit, the moon looks small, but vibrant. There is a singular continent on the planet-facing side of the tidally-locked moon. The landmass overflows with dense green jungles; it is punctuated by twisting rivers and a cascade of great lakes. Aqua blue, coastal shallows line the edges of this paradise.

But while the jungle looks beautiful from orbit, it is terrifying in person. The canopy of the trees and the thick bush before you is alive with the squawks, chirps, roars, rustles and the buzzings of countless living creatures. In the distance, you even spot some hungry thing moving beneath the sun-baked sand.

You are relieved that you and Aurelia have decided to spend your time together relaxing in comfort on the warm beaches.

Servants set up great, covered tents and serve food and drinks. Aurelia looks absolutely gorgeous in her newest swimming gown, but you can tell that she's not quite comfortable. In your time together you've come to understand that your lover prefers to be nude whenever possible. Unfortunately, it can be a little bit awkward and embarassing, especially with all of these servants around.

"Shall we go swimming," she suggests with a warm smile as an ocean breeze washes over you both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoon_Comfort_Title">Comfort</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoon_Comfort_Description">Send the servants away so Aurelia can swim in the nude.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoon_Servants_ObjectiveTooltip">Aurelia will be dissappointed when she realizes that you don't truly accept her.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoonBonding_Title">The Bonding</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndlessRomance_TradePrincess_RelaxMoonBonding_Description">"Really!" she asks, laughing in disbelief, when you tell her that you've sent all the servants away.

"The whole planet? All of it? It's just ours," she asks again, incredulous, as you help her out of her swimming gown. The moment it slips off her firm, lithe body, Aurelia seems so much more free and happy. It's easy to see that you made the right choice.

The two of you spend hours on the beaches and in the warm water. There are so many fish--some alarmingly big--and eventually you walk up and down the shoreline, collecting shells.

"This reminds me of my home," she tells you as she gazes wistfully across the horizon. "My old home," she corrects herself, now looking at you. "You're my home now! Wherever you go, I will follow," she says seductively, before a thought suddenly occurs to her.

"A fire! I wanted to build a fire, tonight." She gazes at you lovingly. "I have something to show you." She laughs, giving you a playful, reprimanding look, "but you had to go and be sweet to me and send all the servants away, and now I guess we'll just have to build it ourselves, now won't we?"

She laughs as she pulls you off without even waiting for a reply. She leads you towards the edge of the jungle to look for dead wood, to build her bonfire. She's so flattered that she can't stop smiling at you. She understands now that you would never deny her anything.

Hours later, you're sore and exhausted, but the fire is built. It rises high up into the dark sky. You stand with Aurelia against the roaring heat. 

"I love you," she says simply. It lacks all the gild and glimmer that normally adorns her words, but it is perfect this way. "I love you," she says again.

And then with a great big smile--a happy smile--she pulls something from an old, leather satchel that she brought with her to the moon. You've seen this bag before--in her private chambers--but she has never let you look inside it.
